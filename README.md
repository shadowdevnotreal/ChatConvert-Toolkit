**ChatConvert Toolkit**

The ChatConvert Toolkit is a versatile set of scripts designed to convert chat conversations stored in CSV format into various more accessible and usable formats including HTML, Markdown, SQLite, and PDF. This toolkit aims to simplify the process of chat data analysis, sharing, and presentation by providing a straightforward and flexible conversion mechanism.

## Features

- **Multiple Format Conversion**: Supports converting CSV chat logs into HTML, Markdown, SQLite, and PDF formats.
- **Easy Installation**: Comes with a Bash script to easily install all prerequisite Python packages.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Utilizes a colorful, interactive menu for selecting the desired conversion format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the ChatConvert Toolkit, ensure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system. The toolkit scripts are designed to be run in environments where Python is accessible.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shadowdevnotreal/ChatConvert-Toolkit.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd ChatConvert-Toolkit

3. **Make the Bash Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x conversion_menu.sh

4. **Run the Menu Script**

   ```bash
   ./conversion_menu.sh

Follow the on-screen instructions to select your conversion option.


**How It Works**

* The toolkit's core functionality is centered around a Bash script (conversion_menu.sh) that presents a menu for users to select the desired conversion format.

* Upon selection, the corresponding Python script is executed to convert the CSV file into the chosen format.
 
* The Bash script also provides an option to install any required Python packages using pip, ensuring that the necessary dependencies are met.


***Note on File Locations:***

*For the toolkit to function correctly, ensure that the CSV file you wish to convert is located in the same directory as the Python scripts. The scripts are designed to automatically find and process files within their current working directory, eliminating the need for specifying full file paths.*

* For example, if your script is located at /path/to/your/script/ and your CSV file named chat.csv is also in /path/to/your/script/, you can simply use:
  csv_file_path = 'chat.csv'

**Installation of Prerequisites**

* The toolkit includes a feature to automatically install required Python packages.

* This functionality is accessible through the toolkit's menu, ensuring that users can easily set up their environment for conversion tasks.


Please ensure you've met all the prerequisites for your operating system before running the installation scripts.
