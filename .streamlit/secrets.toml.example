# Streamlit Secrets Configuration - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
#
# 🔒 HOW THIS WORKS:
# This file is for YOUR testing only when running the app locally.
# The app code NEVER uses secrets for end users - they must enter their own keys.
#
# To use:
#   1. Copy this file: cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
#   2. Add your API key below (for YOUR testing only)
#   3. Never commit secrets.toml to git (it's already in .gitignore)
#
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
#   - Use the Streamlit Cloud secrets UI instead of this file
#   - Settings → Secrets → Paste your key there (for YOUR testing only)
#   - Docs: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management

# Your API key for local testing
# Get your key from: https://console.groq.com/keys
