# Streamlit Secrets Configuration - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
#
# 🔒 HOW THIS WORKS:
# This file is ONLY for running the app locally on your computer.
# The app code does NOT read secrets when deployed - everyone must enter their own API keys.
#
# To use for local development:
#   1. Copy this file: cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
#   2. Add your API key below
#   3. Never commit secrets.toml to git (it's already in .gitignore)
#   4. Restart the Streamlit app
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This ONLY works for local development!
# When deployed (Streamlit Cloud, etc.), the app does NOT use secrets.
# All users (including you) must manually enter their API keys in the sidebar.
#
# Get your API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys
