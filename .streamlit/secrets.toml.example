# Streamlit Secrets Configuration
# Copy this file to secrets.toml and add your actual API keys
#
# 🚨 IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING 🚨
# This file is ONLY for local development/testing!
# DO NOT deploy this file with your API key in production!
# If deployed, your key would be shared with ALL users and you'd pay for everyone's usage!
#
# To use:
#   1. Copy this file: cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
#   2. Add your actual GROQ API key below
#   3. Never commit secrets.toml to git (it's in .gitignore)
#   4. For production deployment, set deployed=true (see below)

[default]
# Get your API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys
# ONLY use this for local development!
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_your_actual_api_key_here"

# Set to true when deploying to production (Streamlit Cloud, etc.)
# This prevents your API key from being shared with all users
# deployed = true
